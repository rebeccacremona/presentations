**Indelible links,**<br>
better textbooks,<br>
**open caselaw,**<br>
digitized collections,<br>
strong dark archives,<br>
summer fellowships,<br>
**explorations for good,**<br>
**and lots more.**

</section>
<section class="middle center">

Access to information changes everything.
{: .h3}

</section>
<section class="middle center">

We **can** open the information of the world<br>
<span class="fragment">...or we can fall short.</span>
{: .h3}

</section>
<section class="middle center">

## Train Your Instincts
{: .pull-down}

If you know what to look for, **you can help**<br>
<span>(...and you'll know when you might need an expert!)</span>{: .fragment}

</section>
<section class="center">

If you know...
{: .pull-down .h3}

- {: .fragment} **who** is impacted, and how
- {: .fragment} **what** the accessibility tree is, and why it matters
- {: .fragment} **when** to intervene most effectively
- {: .fragment} **why** you, personally, have a role

</section>
<section class="middle center">

...then **we can do this!**
{: .h3}

</section>
<section class="middle center">

## **Who** are we talking about?
(everybody)
{: .fragment}

</section>
<section class="center">

Have you ever watched a person control a computer **with their eyes**?

How about using by blowing air into **a straw**, or by activating a **motion-sensor** on their cheek?

Have you ever tried using your computer **without a mouse**? Without a keyboard?

</section>
<section class="center">

### Assistive Technology
{: .pull-down}

- switches
- eye-trackers
- mouth-wands
- voice control
- screen readers
- **...and so much more**

</section>
<section class="middle center">
And further...

</section>
<section class="center">

Have you ever used a computer while holding a baby?

Used your phone on a bumpy bus?

Or in glaring sunlight?

</section>
<section class="center">

### Who? **Everybody.**
{: .h2 .pull-down}

One in five Americans has a disability.
[census.gov](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html)

Five in five benefit under the right circumstances.

</section>
<section class="middle center">

Accessibility problems are caused by <br>
a **mismatch** between a creator's **expectations** <br>
and how people actually interact with a site.

</section>
<section class="middle center">

We can't anticipate everything.
{: .h3}
But we can do our best.
{: .h3 .fragment}

</section>
<section class="center">

Explore your website with a **list of people** in mind, noting:
- obvious problems
- things that need **more testing**, especially testing that you can't do yourself

</section>
<section class="center">

### Try this!

- **unplug your mouse**
- use a small phone
- think about people using screen readers
- have a look in grayscale

</section>
<section class="center">

### Some shockers
{: .pull-down }

- **animations** and motion
- small or proximate click targets
- items that **dynamically appear and disappear**
- readability (e.g. all caps)
- icons without text

</section>
<section class="middle center">

## **What** are the <br> **"accessibility tree"** and the <br> "accessibility API?"

</section>
<section class="middle center">

or... "how does assistive technology work?"
{: .h3}

</section>
<section class="center">

</section>
<section class="center">

Assistive technology needs to know
{: .h3}

- what **is** it? what can you **do with it**?
- what is it **called** (accessible name)?

</section>
<section class="center">

</section>
<section class="center">

The most finicky part of accessibility-related work is <br>
making sure ALL of your site appears correctly in the accessibility tree.

</section>
<section class="middle center">

## **When** to work on accessibility

</section>
<section class="center">

**When?**
{: .h2 .pull-down}

> "It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility from the very beginning of projects."
[Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)

We couldn't agree more!

But what does that look like in practice?

</section>
<section class="center">

### Beginning: build consensus
{: .h2 .pull-down}

- **colors** matter
- major UI components
  - avoid **modals** and **carousels**
  - navigation
  - front-end libraries
- **semantic,** valid **HTML**
- **testing:** when, how and who

</section>
<section class="center">

### Middle: stop the presses
{: .h2 .pull-down}

- **non-semantic** markup
- complex design elements
- choices **directly contrary** to accessibility ("remove focus indicator")
- choices trending towards **never getting done** ("we'll add responsive design later")

</section>
<section class="center">

### End(ish): file issues
{: .h2 .pull-down}

- **Importance:** can't deploy / major / good to have
- **Difficulty:** we need help / medium / easy
- Type of work required
    - helps developers find a rhythm
    - lets project managers **track themes**
      without resorting to giant tickets

</section>
<section class="middle center">

## **Why** do you, personally, have a role?

</section>
<section class="center">

**Can** somebody or something else **solve this?**

- better html?
- artificial intelligence?
- smarter assistive technology?

</section>
<section class="center">
