### Research Topic

**Web Archiving**

</section>
<section class="center">

### Research Problem

Most of the **web archiving software** used by the world is both **poorly understood** and challenging to understand, and much of it is awkward to use, especially outside of **narrow use cases**.

</section>
<section class="center">

That matters, because...
- {: .fragment} it makes problems difficult to **diagnose** and solve
- {: .fragment} it makes it difficult to **improve** the technology and to respond to changes in the web
</section>
<section class="center">

But also because...
- it makes it difficult to **invite newcomers** into the web archiving tech scene
{: .fragment}

...this many years in, I feel like I am still trying get my foot in the door
{: .fragment}

</section>
<section class="center">

### Research Question

Can I write a piece of software that...

a) helps me better **understand WARCs**, the files in which web archives are generally stored, and to better understand how those files are both put together originally, and then **taken apart** and **processed** to make high-fidelity in-browser playbacks?
{: .fragment}

</section>
<section class="center">

### Research Question

Can I write a piece of software that...

b) or, more ambitiously, helps others on **our team** do the same?

c) or, even more ambitiously, **helps others** in the web archiving community or technologists in general do the same?
{: .fragment}

</section>
<section class="center">

Secondarily, can I make it so easy to use that... I will actually use it instead of succumbing to friction, or even so easy to use that others will be **inspired** and **empowered to actually grapple with WARCs** and do things with them?
